        <p>Dear Mr.Momo</p><br>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz university's science faculty to study as part of this year PhD next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the following sections.</p>
       <h2>Starting Date</h2><br>
        <p> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start date for each one are as follows:</p>
        <P>First semester:9 October 2022<br>
         Second semester:15 January 2023<br>

        <P>You can find more information about important university date on our website.</P>
      <h2>Subjects of study</h2><br>
     <p>At the Starz University,we have a pretty open-minded research facility- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and teachnology.You seem like an intelligent, dedciated researcher,and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, inorder of priority:</p>
     <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0</sub> into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>3</sub>.)
     </p>
      <p>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30C (86F),when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)  </p> 
      <p> HTML and CSS construct for respresenting musical scores.</p>
      <P>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to Know?Thanks.
      </P>
      <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3><br>
      <P>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic dances.To answer your question,my favorite dance are as follows,with definitions:</P>
      <p>polynesian chicken dance</p>
           <p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock be "fruitful".</p>
      <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle </p>
          <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
      <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
           <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance styles characterized by "robotic", stilted movements being practiced by inhabitants of  Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>
     
      <p> For more of my research,see my exotic dance research page.</p><br><br>
      <p>Your sincerely,</p>
